Meeting 3
In the third meeting, major project functionality was completed. The website was now fully operational with core features:
Users can create, save, and read reviews.
Movies can be added to a user’s personal database.
The Discover page works with a functional search bar, pulling results from the movie API.
Next steps included building the profile page, refining user-specific features, and beginning detailed user testing to identify and resolve edge cases or unexpected behaviors.
