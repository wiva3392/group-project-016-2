Meeting 1
In the first meeting, the team confirmed that the database setup was completed, including table structures for users, movies, and reviews. We assigned roles for the next development phase:
One member will handle the static pages (Home, Login, Register).
Two member will work on login/logout flow, including password hashing and test database queries.
A third member will research and test external movie APIs to determine which one best fits our needs for data retrieval.
The group also discussed the initial plan for the backend architecture, outlining routes, controllers, and data flow. Everyone left with clear deliverables to bring to the second meeting.
